                        "Failed plans should not be interpreted as a failed vision. Visions don't 
                        change, they are only refined. Plans rarely stay the same, and are scrapped 
                        or adjusted as needed. Be stubborn about the vision, but flexible with your 
                        plan." ~ John C. Maxwell

                        "Only a man of prayer can lead others to celebration because everyone
                        who comes in contact with him realizes that he draws power from a source
                        they cannot easily locate but they know is strong and deep. The freedom
                        that gives him a certain independence is not authoritarian or distant.
                        Rather, it makes him rise above immediate needs and most urgent desires
                        or the people around him. He is deeply moved by things happening around
                        him but he does not allow himself to be crushed by them. He listens
                        attentively, speaks with the self-evident authority, but does not easily
                        get excited or nervous. In all he says and does, he provides to a vision
                        that guides life. To that vision he is obedient. It makes him distinguish
                        sharply between what is important and what is not. He is not insensitive
                        to what excites people, but evaluates their needs differently by seeing
                        them in the perspective of his vision. He is happy and content when
                        people listen to him, but he does not form cliques. He does not attach
                        himself to anybody exclusively. What he says sounds convincing and
                        obvious, but he does not force his opinion on anybody and is not
                        irritated when people do not accept his ideas or do not fulfill his will.
                        All this shows that his vision is what counts for him that he strives to
                        make it come true." ~ Henri Nouwen, Creative Ministry

                        "Vision is something that takes some form of inner strength. To stay focused 
                        on one goal to the exclusion of all else. That even though you will be 
                        confronted with man different roads or options to live life, you still remain
                        true to your vision." ~ Peter Alford
